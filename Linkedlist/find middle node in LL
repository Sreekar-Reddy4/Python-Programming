#First approach

#Input: head -> 3 -> 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3

#Output(value at returned node): 7

#Explanation: There are 5 nodes, so the middle node is the 3rd Node, with value 7.


#Input: head -> 2 -> 9 -> 1 -> 4 -> 0 -> 4

#Output(value at returned node): 4

#Explanation: There are 6 nodes, thus both the 3rd and 4th nodes are middle.
So the 2nd middle node (4th Node) is returned with value 4.

##First approach

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
    
    def add_node(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node
    
    def len_ll(self):
        count = 0
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            count += 1
            curr = curr.next
        return count
    
    def middle_ll(self):
        res = self.len_ll()
        curr = self.head
        middle_node = res // 2 +1# Corrected to 0-based index
        var = 1
        while curr:
            if var == middle_node:
                return curr.data
            var += 1
            curr = curr.next

sll = LinkedList()
lst = [3, 8, 7, 1, 3]
for i in lst:
    sll.add_node(i)
print(sll.middle_ll())


##Second approach

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
    
    def add_node(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node
    
    def middle_ll(self):
        slow = self.head
        fast = self.head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next       # Move slow by 1
            fast = fast.next.next  # Move fast by 2
        return slow.data           # Slow will be at the middle
