Time complexity:-

Not the actual time taken but amount of time taken as a function of input size(n).

Example:-
1) It is not the code execution time like 0.01 sec etc basically it depends on OS like windows,mac and linux etc.

2) Then what actually time complexity is meant ?

   Let's go with a simple example Linear search
   arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
   n=len(arr)
   target=2
   for i in range(n):
      if arr[i]==target:
          print(i)

   In the above example 
   If n==1 loop runs one time
   If n==2 loop runs twice
   If n==3 loop runs thrice
   If n==1000 loop runs thousand times and so on

   So the best case for linear search is if target is found in the first index itself and worst case is found if target is found in the last index.

   Now we evaluate time complexity for linear search

  if i/p size n=1 then operation time is 1
  if i/p size n=2 then operation time is 2
  if i/p size n=3 then operation time is 3
  if i/p size n=4 then operation time is 4
  if i/p size n=5 then operation time is 5
  ........................................
  
  if i/p size n=10^5 then operation time is 10^5
  

  By observing the trend we can build a mathematical equation y=x 
  f(x) = x ----> It can be written as O(n)
  
  Note:- Our aim is to build a algorithm which works better in worst case scenarios because in real word applications handle millions of data.




Big O Notation :- It is a symbol representation of a function example := $5 

For a linear search worst case time complexity is O(n) 
Similarly for a complex equations like f(n) = 4*n^2+5*n+1 
Procedure to find complexity for the above functions
1) ignore constants 
2) consider highest power of variable
Answer is O(n^2)


Space complexity :-

Amount of space taken by an algorithm as a function of input size of n :

i/p ---> arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

o/p ---> sum -- New variable 

So irrespective of i/p size of an array the space complexity of new variables will be O(K). Where 'K' defines constant where k might be any number
As we ignore constants therefore 
Space complexity will be O(1).


Common time complexities:-

O(1) - Constant

Sum numbers from 1 to N.
int n = 10
res = n*(n+1)/2
print(res)

In the above program we are not using any loops so the time complexity is O(1)

O(n) 

Examples :- Calculating n factorial,kadanes algorithm and calculation of factorial using dp.


O(n*n),O(n*n*n)

Examples :- It is applied for number of for loops and application is bubble sort , insertion sort and selection sort worst case time complexities.

If it is two - O(n*n)

If it is three - O(n*n*n)


O(logn) ,O(nlogn)

Examples :- Merge sort , quick sort , binary search , greedy algos
O(logn) ---> Binary search
O(nlogn) ---> Merge sort , quick sort , greedy algos


O(2^n) and O(n!)

Examples :- Recursion time complexity
